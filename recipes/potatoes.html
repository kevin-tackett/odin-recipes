        <h2>Creamy Cheesy Au Gratin Potatoes</h2>
        <p>
            These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite â€” he considers it a special occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish combine to make a deliciously addictive experience. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad and some French bread. Experiment with different cheeses for variety.
